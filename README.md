## Reproduce the result
### Requirements

- Python 3.13 or later.
- pip installed on your system.
- zip on linux to extract compressed files (on Windows, any software capable of decompressing a .zip file is suitable).

### Linux and MacOS users
A [shell script](./reproduce_results.sh) has been created to simplify and expedite the process of reproducing the results. Make sure to grant execution permission to the script.
Make sure to grant execution permission to the script.
```sh
chmod +x reproduce_results.sh
```
Then, execute it
```sh
./reproduce_results.sh
```

This script automates the setup and execution of the FAIRness evaluation workflow. It performs the following steps:
1.	Environment Setup: Creates and activates a Python virtual environment.
2.	Dependency Installation: Installs the required Python packages via pip.
3.	Data Extraction: Decompresses the quality data files generated by KGHeartBeat, which are compressed to reduce storage footprint and comply with GitHub size constraints.
4.	FAIRness Evaluation: Executes [main.py](./src/main.py) to compute the FAIRness based on the extracted quality data. The results are saved in the [./data/fairness_evaluation_results](./data/fairness_evaluation_results/) directory.
5.	Correlation Analysis: Computes correlation matrices on the FAIRness results. The outputs are saved as CSV files and visualized as heatmaps (PNG format) in the [./data/correlation_results](./data/correlation_results/) directory.

### Windows users

1. Create and activate a Python Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```sh
# Create a Python venv
python -m venv venv
# Activate it
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install the requirements
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Unzip the KGHeartBeat quality data with any software capable of decompressing a .zip file is suitable. The file to be decompressed are located in the folder [data/quality_analysis_results](./data/quality_analysis_results) (put the extracted CSV files in the same directory of the zip file)

4. Run the main.py file

```sh
python main.py
```

The main will execute the FAIRness evaluation based on the extracted quality data. The results are saved in the [./data/fairness_evaluation_results](./data/fairness_evaluation_results/) directory.
Then the correlation analysis is performed on the FAIRness results. The outputs are saved as CSV files and visualized as heatmaps (PNG format) in the [./data/correlation_results](./data/correlation_results/) directory.
